Spirit of the Hive
================

#### Version the.buzz.0.1

*-- prior versions --*  
*didnt.exist.0.0*

This is completely exploratory at this point, but the idea is for SPOT to be a
dwarffortress-like about managing a beehive. The philosophy is to stick to
apiology, building an atmosphere based as closely as possible on the real
science and biology behind the life of the bee.

Building
----------------

### Requirements

- pygame
- cx_Freeze

Building should be straightforward, as much as

`$ python setup.py bdist_mac`

Of course, this is for mac. There are other cx_Freeze commands for building on
Linux and Windows.
